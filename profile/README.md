# How Fast Indexing Works

Fast indexing is a process that helps search engines quickly discover and list new or updated pages from your website. Normally, search engines crawl websites on their own schedule, which can take hours or even days. Fast indexing speeds up this process so your content becomes visible in search results much sooner.

## 1. URL Submission
Fast indexing begins when a URL is submitted to an indexing API. Instead of waiting for a crawler to randomly visit your page, you notify the search engine directly that new or updated content is available.

## 2. Instant Crawl Request
Once submitted, the search engine receives a priority crawl request. This tells the system to immediately check your page for content, links, meta tags, and overall structure.

## 3. Verification & Processing
The engine then verifies that the URL is valid and accessible. After fetching the page, it analyzes the content—keywords, freshness, quality, speed, and security.

## 4. Index Entry Creation
If everything is valid, the search engine adds the page to its index. This means your content becomes available to appear in search results almost instantly.

## 5. Ranking Evaluation
After indexing, the page goes through ranking algorithms. These decide how high the page should appear in search results based on relevance, authority, and user intent.
